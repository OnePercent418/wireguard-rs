## Fast, modern and secure VPN tunnel
Target of this project is to have a user space Rust implementation of WireGuard.

This implementation is currently _work in progress_ and is notable to work in the intended behavior.

## Development workflow
Actually the main repository is located at [git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-rs](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-rs) whereas the
main repository maintainer is [Sascha Grunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert). This also means that the usage of the
GitHub issue and pull request mechanisms **are possible to use** whereas the contribution results are mirrored back to
the original repository.
